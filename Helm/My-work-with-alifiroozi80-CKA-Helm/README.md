Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes

Some Helm Features:

Sharing Helm Charts
Templating Engine
Same application across different environments

Helm features (Sharing Helm Charts & Templating Engine) are super helpful for CI/CD pipelines or DevOps Best-Practices

Let's say you have 3 environments:

- Development
- Staging
- Production

Now you can manage all those three environments with one single Chart.
